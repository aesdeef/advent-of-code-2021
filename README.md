# Advent of code 2021

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles.

For each day, put the input in an `input.txt` file in the `day_##` folder. The `_raw` folders contain the code I had at the moment of getting the second star. It won't be pretty and it might be difficult to understand (and sometimes tailored for the specific input I got), but it was what got the job done for me. A nicer solution, written without the time pressure, would go to the `_python` folder. I may add solutions in other languages; those would go into `_${language name}` folders.

I'm using Python 3.10, although many of the solutions should work on lower versions as well.

Feel free to start a discussion if you have any questions or suggestions.
