Here's my attempt at solving today's puzzle in Kotlin, a language I knew next to nothing about until today.

Note to self: here's how to run it
```
kotlinc sonar_sweep.kt -include-runtime -d output.jar
kotlin output.jar
```

Any suggestions on how to improve it / make it more idiomatic are very welcome
